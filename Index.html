	<ul>
		<li class="railway"> I recently graduated Seattle University with a degree in Psychology and have lived in Seattle for five years now. After graduating I hoped to move to Vietnam, but a safe and full time offer kept me here. This has been a wonderful job, but it is time to move on and pursue something that makes me feel creatively fulfilled! </li>
		<li class="railway"> I am taking this class as a way to challenge myself and to learn something new. It is a way of thinking that I'm not used to! </li>
